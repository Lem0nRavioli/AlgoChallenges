"""
Recursive function to calculate chess moves given initial pos then objective
rules: a move can only be up or right.
completed and steps values start Ã  0
for more clarity, you can refacto that and use those as global variables
for this:
    uncomment every line commented
    if there is a line strictly under it, comment it

completed give number of path
steps is extra variable to search for correlation between numbers (don't pay attention to it)
